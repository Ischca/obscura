# Obscura

From obscure to clear. Obscura turns concise DSL into auto‑laid out SVG diagrams for business slides.

## Why
- Declarative `.slide` DSL; no manual coordinates
- ELK‑powered layered, orthogonal routing; stable layouts
- Rich patterns: Flow, Boundary, Guardrail, Swimlane, Timeline, Matrix, Board, Venn, Heatmap, Cycle, Funnel, OKR/Hierarchy/Decision, SIPOC, Journey/Blueprint, Fishbone, Sankey
- SVG first; review here with Storybook Controls

## Try It

Edit the DSL in place using Controls on any story. A minimal Flow:

```text
flow title: Suggest Workflow
path: Developer -> Suggest -> Commit -> PR -> ReviewCI
forbid: Suggest -X-> PR
```

<Canvas>
  <DiagramViewer dsl={`flow title: Suggest Workflow\npath: Developer -> Suggest -> Commit -> PR -> ReviewCI\nforbid: Suggest -X-> PR`} />
  </Canvas>

## Navigation
- Examples → Basic/Boundary/Venn/All
